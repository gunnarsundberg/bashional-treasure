So here's what we've done: we used `cd treasure` to open the treasure directory, and now `ls` shows us what's in our current working directory (that's just a fancy name for the folder we're in right now). Pro tip: you can type `pwd` if you ever forget what directory you're in. Now say we type `ls` (remeber, we're in the `treasure` directory) and we get `rubies` and `pearls` as two files. We want to know what's inside those files, but these aren't directories like we're used to. These are files. How can we look at our riches if they aren't directories?
