To change what directory (or folder) you are in, use the command `cd` followed by the name of the directory you would like to change to. For example, say you are currently in a directory with a folder in it called `treasure`, and you would like to go to that directory. To make that happen, you would type `cd treasure`, and you will magically be transported to the `treasure` directory. Next step: collect your spoils and join the 1% in their oppression of the other 99%. Sounds great, doesn't it? It's really that easy in the bash shell (that's the program you are using right now)!
