So we have `ls` to view everything in our current directory. Once we see a directory we'd like to change to, we use `cd`. To view the contents of a file, we use `cat`. One more thing: to move back up to the directory we came from, we can just type `cd ..` with those two periods taking the place of a directory name. We can now go anywhere we want and look at anything we want! This will sure come in handy when we get to the Charlotte.
