Notes

Plan to steal the Declaration of Independence

1. Go to the gala at the national archives
2. Find a way to lift employee fingerprints off of an object at the gala. We don't want the object itself, just the fingerprints.
3. Go back out of the gala and down the hallway. Stop when you find a fingerprint reader.
4. Put the fingerprint in the fingerprint reader, and then look for a way to activate it.
5. This should give you access to the restricted area (from the hallway)
6. Look for an elevator control unit. Once you find it, you'll have to enter a password. Search the staff_file in your bag for 'Password' using grep.
7. Enter the password and take the elevator to the preservation room.
8. Put the declaration in your bag and escape!
