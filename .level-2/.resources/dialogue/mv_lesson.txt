In order to grab the fingerprints and the declaration, you will have to make use of a new command called 'mv'. To move a file, just type 'mv' followed by the name of the file you would like to move and the name of the destination. For example, if I wanted to move a file called 'declaration' to a directory called bag that is in my current working directory, I would type 'mv declaration bag'. Now, if I type 'ls bag', I will see 'declaration'. Neat!
