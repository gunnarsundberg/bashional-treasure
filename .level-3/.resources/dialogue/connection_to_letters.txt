Ben:  Based on my background knowledge and ability to make huge logical jumps that somehow work becasue I'm Nicolas Cage, I believe that the message on the back is somehow connected to the Silence Dogood Letters. I have them in my bag. I just need a way to search for the given clues in the letters. Once I have the clues, I'll write them in my journal.
