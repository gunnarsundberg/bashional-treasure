One way to write to files in Linux is to use 'vim'. It's not very intuitive, but if you learn it well, it's very useful. Sadly, you won't learn it well during this short game, but we will build a foundation nonetheless. To edit a file, just type 'vim' followed by the filename. In this case, you'll be editing your notes, so you would type 'vim notes'. Once you're in the vim editor, type 'i' to go into insert mode, then type as you normally would. You can use your arrow keys to navigate around the file. If you would like to navigate faster, look up more vim keyboard shortcuts. When you're done, hit the escape key, then type ':wq!' to write to your file and quit. You can use this to add clues to your notes!
